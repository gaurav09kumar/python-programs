Line Equation
Problem Description:
You are given the slope m and the y-intercept b of a line, along with a value x. Your task is to calculate and return the value of y using the equation of a line in slope-intercept form:
y=mx+b
Input:
Three floating-point numbers: slope, intercept, and x.
Output:
A floating-point number representing the value of yyy corresponding to the given xxx.
Example:
Input: slope = 2, intercept = 3, x = 4
Output: 11.0
Input: slope = 1.5, intercept = -2, x = 2
Output: 1.0
